# Local Weather App

This is an app I created to retrieve a user's local weather forecast using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The OpenWeatherMap API is very robust and provides an abundance of weather info so I thought it was
a perfect opportunity to test my usage of API calls and retrieving info from the user, which in this case is their location
through a form input.

## Optimizations

My initial version only displayed the current temperature for the user but since the API offers a futurecast as well I also incorportated that 
feature into the app so a user can see the predicted temperature for the rest of the day.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned about parsing JSON responses into objects and manipulating and updating the DOM
